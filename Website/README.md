# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I started this website to not only apply what I'm learning but also have a place for my notes. Before starting the project, I had pictured using google docs or word to take notes for the program. I want to keep working on this website. It will be useful keeping everything in here. 

# Installation

The project is a website. There is nothing to install. 

# Usage 

There is not many notes at the moment. Basic bullets points in HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript can be found here. Inside the console, there is suggestions on what to read first. 

## Credits

I am the only who has worked on it so far. Hopefully in the future there will others who can contribute on the website.
